# DEAN-PHD-TEXT-COLLECTOR
This is a python script for collecting data from Science Direct and EoL. The data it collects from Science Direct are titles and abstracts related to a search query identified in the config. The text it collects from EoL are the Taxonomy Identifications and any textual description information. All text are saved as either xml files (Science Direct) or text Files (EoL). This project is still at early stage development
